# New York City Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

The objective of the project is to predict the time required for taxi-cab trips from a point A to point B. Academically, the project will provide better insights into data mining techniques especially in the domain of regression; aiming to develop an effective, efficient trip time prediction models to dealing with a dataset with the following properties:

● Location ● Vendors ● Passenger Count ● Day of the week ● Trip Direction

Algorithms Considered
Experimented with the following techniques and compared their results:

● Linear Regression ● Gradient Boosting ● Neural Network
